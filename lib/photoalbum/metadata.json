{"name":"PhotoAlbum","description":"Reads from \/sdcard\/PhotoAlbum directory to get a list of .png images (you'll have to create the \/sdcard mount point if it doesn't exist).  If sdcard doesn't mount it'll use \/lib\/PhotoAlbum\/media as the source directory. A button freezes on one image, B button changes images every 30 seconds.  Step through the images with left and right, turn random order on and off with up and down.  Start quits and select reloads the application. It has one bug in that if it is in reload mode the buttons won't work anymore.  Still trying to figure out a fix for that.","category":"graphics","author":"leidentech","revision":1}
